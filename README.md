# 12 o'clocks

This repository hosts a collaborative p5.js port of John Maeda's 12 o'clocks,
originally written for Mac OS 9 and released in 1997. Due to the Power PC
hardware that Mac OS 9 ran on, it is very hard to emulate the original artwork
and without access to a Mac of the era it is difficult to view. Therefore, we
are collaborating to bring John Maeda's 12 o'clocks to the web in p5.js. The
current version is available to be viewed at this repository's [GitHub Pages][0]
